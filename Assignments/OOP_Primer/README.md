## Definitions

#### Abstraction:
> The concept of object-oriented programming that “shows” only essential attributes and “hides” unnecessary information
>
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216170113-b0f7ad4d-4c77-467c-ba7c-734020f01970.png)

#### Attributes / Properties:
> Defines a particular property of an object, element or file.

#### Class:
> A blueprint for creating objects, providing initial values for state, and implementations of behavior.
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216172471-0ce2efcc-6fb5-457c-9f1f-f8757c91bab3.png)

#### Class Variable:
> Defines a specific attribute or property for a class

#### Composition:
> A class that references one or more objects of other classes in instance variables.
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216174087-042ec5ca-de48-4eee-af94-f5a573870c82.png)

#### Constructor:
> A special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes a newly created object of that type.
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216174159-f92747cc-e5f1-42b5-8aa7-e8c1567a6078.png)

#### Encapsulation:
> The bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216174815-370e30ef-052a-49e8-922a-75cdd079bb2c.png)

#### Friends:
> A function that is given the same access as methods to private and protected data.
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216175177-19932721-920d-44cc-b694-cb358525b932.png)

#### Inheritance:
> When a class derives from another class.
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216175391-68970d89-6d60-4823-b680-502dc9182574.png)

#### Instance Variable:
> A variable defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance.
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216176075-bcb16843-f6b0-407f-90b1-4de2763ce038.png)

#### Member Variable:
> a variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216177192-43b2622f-a65a-4da3-8409-2dbc26da2855.png)

#### Method:
> a procedure associated with a message and an object.
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216177696-2153f0ce-0c97-40dd-935f-e0c64008bb9b.png)

#### Multiple Inheritance:
> a class or an object inherits characteristics and properties from more than one parent class or object.
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216178760-4e21fb5a-3faa-4604-859e-6c09570c9bbd.png)

#### Object:
> They are the units of code that are eventually derived from the process.
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216180354-b101fb9a-48f7-4ded-a8c2-0df3757ba4e9.png)

#### Overloading:
> A form of polymorphism in OOP, allows objects or methods to act in different ways according to the means in which they are used.
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216180725-f4659a75-1017-40db-8637-bd1141b76c2b.png)

#### Polymorphism:
> Allows a specific routine to use variables of different types at different times.
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216181363-3342301d-45e3-40d0-b4d6-4419d8bb06ee.png)

#### Public / Private / Protected:
> Public means everyone is allowed to access.
>
> Private means that only members of the same class are allowed to access.
>
> Protected means that members of subclasses are also allowed.
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216181822-7b6e2d72-e697-4257-a438-bb19b04107f9.png)

#### Static:
> A member variable of a given class which is shared across all instances, and is accessible as a member variable of these objects.
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122930814/216184096-297e06c0-5518-45d8-ab46-cb22f46fb1ae.png)

#### Virtual:
> A function or method used to override the behavior of the function in an inherited class with the same signature to achieve the polymorphism.
>
